          "A broken heart is all that's left\\nI'm still fixing all the cracks\\nLost a couple of pieces when\\nI carried it, carried it, carried it home\\n\\nI'm afraid of all I am\\nMy mind feels like a foreign land\\nSilence ringing inside my head\\nPlease, carry me, carry me, carry me home\\n\\nI spent all of the love I saved\\nWe were always a losing game\\nSmall-town boy in a big arcade\\nI got addicted to a losing game\\n\\nAah, aah\\nOoh, ooh\\nAll I know, all I know\\nLoving you is a losing game\\n\\nHow many pennies in the slot?\\nGiving us up didn't take a lot\\nI saw the end before it begun\\nStill I carried, I carried, I carry on\\n\\nAah, aah\\nOoh, ooh\\nAll I know, all I know\\nLoving you is a losing game\\n\\nAah, aah\\nOoh, ooh\\nAll I know, all I know\\nLoving you is a losing game\\n\\nI don't need your games, game over\\nGet me off this rollercoaster\\n\\nAah, aah\\nOoh, ooh\\nAll I know, all I know\\nLoving you is a losing game\\n\\nAah, aah\\nOoh, ooh\\nAll I know, all I know\\nLoving you is a losing game",
